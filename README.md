# ECS (Experimental Compression Stuff)

Looking out for some suitable compression for n2n, I happened to come across Pasi Ojala's pucrunch. Not only, that it is extremly assymetric and thus lightweight in terms of decompression, it also is very explainatory giving full particulars in a wonderfully comprehensable way.

Having read that extremly inspring article (converted to markdown, see pucrunch folder) more than just several times, I started off to create my own implementation which uses some of the original code and also includes some optimizations.

More details to follow.
